# Louis Warford

A contemplative programmer and scientist. Inspired by the applications for Data Science in solving real world problems.

## About me
My love of problem solving initially sent me to persue the field of Physics. While achieving my master of Physics i discovered a new love for programming, especially in the use of system modelling. This eventually led to me developing a keen interest in Data Science after graduating.

Everyday I push myself to learn something new. I set out with a theory or general idea and, using the vast expanse of online knowledge, teach myself about all the tools and skills I will need to achieve the goals necessary in the project.
